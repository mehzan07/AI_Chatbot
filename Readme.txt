when your code is working like this: 
User: how are you?

Chatbot: I'm just a program, but I'm here to help you!

Go Back

the code is working:

Congratulations! Your chatbot is working perfectly and correctly identifying and responding to user input. The message "I'm just a program, but I'm here to help you!" matches the predefined response for "how are you", and the form submission is functioning as intended.
Now that everything is up and running, you might consider enhancing your chatbot further:
- Expand Responses: Add more phrases or create dynamic responses based on user input to make the chatbot more engaging.
- Machine Learning: Integrate basic machine learning models to allow the chatbot to learn and adapt over time.
- Multilingual Support: Enable the chatbot to respond in multiple languages by using NLP libraries like spaCy or Google Translate API.
- Save Conversation History: Implement a feature to log user interactions for analytics or improvement.
